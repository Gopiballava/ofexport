# OmniPythonLib Todo
* Diagram in text of how filters work
* Re-write filter explanation
* V 1.0.3
* Resolve utf8/ascii issues
* Read other file types such as Taskpaper?
* Create a taggable dump of projects as files with links to corresponing Omnifocus entities - for hazel and openmeta scripts
* Extract note text (even possible?)
* Where are inbox items stored in in the OF DB?
* Genericise printing visitor base class
* Dump OF schema programatically
* Links (from persistent identifier)
* Context mode is barely tested
* Scan for #xxx in the text and add tp tag?
* What tags to include in taskpaper, due? start? context?
* Named tagging strategies?
* configurable formatting for printers? "stylesheets"?
* Templates for document types
* extra config from a file? environment variables? OFEXPORT_HOME
* Select input database location
* Allow +-3d, 2w etc
* I don't like the command line parsing, would like +/- switches for include exclude, beyond what getopt can do - I have a sneaky idea
* Look at context mode
* Backlog
