## OmniPythonLib Todo
* Update help with new command line args
* Document new command line args
* Update examples
* list of attributes and aliases
* 
* use lamdas instead of thesse little get/match fns
* test script isn't going to work - but less relevant
* rationalise other args
* V1.0.5
* proper logging: with on/off on the command line
* Assertions to prevent mis-wiring of type hierarchies
* don't need the main entry points in the conversion modules any more
* A visitor to prepend type to items - for debugging
* Where are inbox items stored in in the OF DB?
* raw arg on command line equivalent to "-i arg"? Might be nice...
* Context sort mode and others
* Try ofexport with omnifocus 2
* Document How I use it
* from == since in dates? maybe tokenise properly
* V1.0.6
* Allow "weekend", "weekday" in date ranges
* I don't like the command line parsing, would like +/- switches for include exclude, beyond what getopt can do - I have a sneaky idea
* Json output
* Allow +-3d, 2w etc
* Select input database location
* Extra config from a file? environment variables? OFEXPORT_HOME
* Templates for document types
* Configurable formatting for printers? "stylesheets"?
* Named tagging strategies? (or rely on templates)
* What tags to include in taskpaper, due? start? context?
* Scan for #xxx in the text and add tp tag?
* Links (from persistent identifier)
* Dump OF schema programatically
* Extract note text (even possible?)
* Create a taggable dump of projects as files with links to corresponing Omnifocus entities - for hazel and openmeta scripts
* Read other file types such as Taskpaper?
* Resolve utf8/ascii issues - not sure what's going on - redirecting stdout "changes things"?!?!?!
* Can I detect a if a project is paused?
* Backlog
