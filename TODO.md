# OmniPythonLib Todo
* Add a simple completed/not completed filter rather than just rely on regexps
* Proofread the documentation again
* Add installation documentation
* Experiment with making date ranges more useable
* "from yesterday" - genericise fetching a date from a string
* Add project flagging filter
* Links (from persistent identifier)
* Dump OF schema programatically
* Write a unit test that tries each filter
* Genericise printing visitor base class
* Where are inbox items stored in in the OF DB?
* Filter on start dates - project and task
* Replicate the standard OF due+flagged filters
* Sort on start dates
* Extract note text (even possible?)
* Create a taggable dump of projects as files with links to corresponing Omnifocus entities - for hazel and openmeta scripts
* Read other file types such as Taskpaper?
* Resolve utf8/ascii issues
* configurable formatting for printers? "stylesheets"?
* Templates for document types
