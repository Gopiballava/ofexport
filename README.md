# No Longer Supported #

**Note [ofexport2](https://github.com/psidnell/ofexport2) is now available.**

If that's not to your liking then the original ofexport will stay here but I won't be updating it any further.

There are several forks of the code you might want to look at.

The original documentation is [here](https://github.com/psidnell/ofexport/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md).
